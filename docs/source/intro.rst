Intro
*****

This project is an attempt to code on a pet project for a long time. I mean
it is not a "I make this project on a weekend" kind of thing. I thinking
of it as an opportunity to shape habits of long-term development.

The main idea behind this project is that often big companies set different
promotions for different regions. But what if you don't have a strong
plan for your trip destination. You just have a general idea that you need
to set up a vacation in Europe and it must be cheap as possible.
