interaction between the data model and external api service in proxy class.

    Proxy class for city model.

    Usage

    .. code-block:: python

        proxy = CityProxy('Riga')
        city = proxy.get()

    An explanation is needed. First - we created an instance of this proxy
    class and passed a parameter ``city_name``. In our example it is ``Riga``.

    Now we can call ``get`` method of this proxy class to get city
    instance from the database.

    The algorithm is like this:

    1. The get method tries to find a matching variant of a provided city name
        in the database. If it succeeded, it returns linked to variant model
        city model. End of method run.
    2. If get method fails to find a matching variant in the database, it calls
        a proxy method ``call_services``. That method is starting to send
        requests to external api server.

        1. If external api is found information about this city, it returns to
            method ``get`` all necessary info, already formatted and cleaned up
            by service class. In that case ``get`` method creates in database
            new city record, new variant record and links them. Than returns
            city instance from database and end of ``get`` method.
        2. If external api is failed to find information about the desired
            city, then we in trouble and a severe letter is sent
            to the administrator.
