Views
=====

This is REST views, here I created ``BaseGeoViewSet`` inherited from
:class:`rest_framework.viewsets.ViewSet`. The main reason for this is that
in this application I wanted to get short information about the geographical
object and detailed.

This ``CityViewSet`` and ``CountryViewSet`` are generating two kinds of
URLs with different serializers

* ``/<geo object>/<name>/``
* ``/<geo_object/<name>/detail/``

Detail endpoint is different because they contain information about
linked discounts. It is a lot of information but can be very handy.
