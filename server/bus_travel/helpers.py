    Cleanup any text (but designed for city names).

    Unfortunately, name of the city can contain special for European
    languages symbols - diacritics, that can interfere with
    geo(de)coding process.

    >>> serialize('The fran√ßois')
    'Francois'

    Can be extended with more ``.replace()`` calls if needed.
    Also decided that creating a variable for every
    processing steps will be a waste of resources.

    P.S. I love this clean representation of chained methods.
    Javascript is not ugly, but prejudices are.
